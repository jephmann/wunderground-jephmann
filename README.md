A web-coding test, based on the wunderground.com API

Whether I meet the deadline (morning of December 8, 2014) or not,
I intend to complete as much of the test's requirements as I can.

"Could you create a very simple single page javascript/HTML/CSS application that
 connects to the wunderground.com weather API. The page should do the following:

    Allow a user to enter a zip code
    Display a three day forecast for the entered zip code.
    Connect to wunderground.com API via AJAX to submit zip code and get forcast information. 
    Display a spinning circle over the forecast while waiting for API data to load.
    Submit the project to us in a public github.com repository.

Feel free to use whatever javascript libraries you feel are appropriate.

Can you do this by Monday morning?"
